Starting young can provide certain advantages, such as more time for learning and gaining experience. It allows individuals to develop a strong foundation in programming concepts and technologies early on. However, it is important to note that success in programming is not solely dependent on starting at a young age. People can start learning and building a career in programming at any age and still achieve great success. What matters most is having a passion for programming, continuous learning, and a growth mindset. These qualities, combined with dedication and hard work, can lead to a successful career in programming regardless of the starting age.***"
